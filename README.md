# mood_snapshot

This website was designed for patients who wish to monitor their mental health status on any given date. They can use this site to take the PHQ-9 health
questionnaire used by mental health professionals to determine a patient's level of depression. They can also use the site to compose a journal entry for that 
date and print their results for their mental health professional's records or just for their own records.
